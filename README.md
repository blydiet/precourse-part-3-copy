# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE PART 3!!!

In part 2 of the precourse, you will be doing more JavaScript challenges while building a copy of the "Google" page and a more complex layout as seen on Twitter's "bootstrap" page. Part 3 of the precourse is equipped with a JSON parser and exposure to JavaScript frameworks. We aspire you to be proficient in your JavaScript skills and become a better programmer through the process.

If this is challenging, don't be worried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.

## You (STILL) Need To Know How To Use GitHub!

Please refer to the **"How do I get started"** section in [Github.md](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-part-1/blob/master/GitHub.md#how-do-i-get-started) from precourse-part-1 if you need a refresher on how to fork and clone your repo.

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided part 3 of the precourse challenges into three sections: a JSON parser and an Instagram clone. For the JSON parser challenge, you will be creating a JSON parser yourself, although it already exists as a JavaScript method. Please read the "README.md" files inside the two folders for further instructions about each challenge. Be creative with your project and show us that you want to have fun with programming. Good Luck!

## What do I do when I am done?
