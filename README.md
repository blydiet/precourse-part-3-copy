# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE!!!

## Please Read Everything Before Proceeding...

Welcome To Codesmith Precourse.

The precourse is designed to help you become experienced in the fundamental JavaScript concepts. Much of the challenges may be familiar, especially in the first portion but please be patient since a big end project awaits where you will utilize all your JavaScript skills to build come interesting projects. Part 1 of the precourse is designed to solidify your basics in JavaScript. In part 2 of the precourse, you will be doing more JavaScript challenges while building a copy of the "Google" page. Part 3 of the precourse is equipped with a JSON parser and exposure to a more complex web app, perhaps even a JS framework. We aspire you to be proficient in your JavaScript skills and become a better programmer through the process.

This precourse will truly help you understand the core material and get you ready for our full time program. Plus, it is a great opportunity for you to show us that you can handle our rigorous curriculum.

If this is challenging, don't be worried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.

## You Need To Know How To Use GitHub!

By now, you should already know how to use GitHub. If not, make sure you read the ["GitHub.md"](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md) file to get yourself familiar with the processes. **YOU NEED TO FORK AND CLONE THIS REPO SO READ ["GitHub.md"](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md) CAREFULLY TO LEARN HOW!**

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided part 3 of the precourse challenges into three sections: a JSON parser and an Instagram clone. For the JSON parser challenge, you will be creating a JSON parser yourself, although it already exists as a JavaScript method. Please read the "README.md" files inside the two folders for further instructions about each challenge. Be creative with your project and show us that you want to have fun with programming. Good Luck!
