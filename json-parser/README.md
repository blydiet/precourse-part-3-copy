## What is JSON?

Often data is stored in the server in a different format from what is readable by the client side. [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json.asp), or JavaScript Object Notation, is a standard format for passing data between various components of the web. It provides a method for easy communication between client side and server side. JSON Parser is used to transform the data from the readable JSON format (or JSON string) into a structure JavaScript object.

Your task is to create this parser that will take a string in JSON format and return a JavaScript object in the appropriate key/value format.
